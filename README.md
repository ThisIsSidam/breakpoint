# Scroll Guard 🛡️  
**Break free from doomscrolling.**

Scroll Guard is a mobile tool designed to end **YouTube Shorts** and **Instagram Reels** scrolling addiction. Built for those looking to reclaim their time and attention.

---

## ❓ Why

Since these type of apps use accessibility service, it is quite hard to trust them. I created the app to keep it open source and let the users view what's going on in the app.

## 🚀 Current Features

- ⛔ **Force Exit from Shorts & Reels**  
  Detects when the user opens YouTube Shorts or Instagram Reels and forcefully exits to Home Screen to prevent unintentional binge-scrolling.

## 🧠 Coming Soon

- 🔻 **More apps**
  I can and may add support for more apps. You are also free to fork or raise a pull request for any support you want.

- 🎯 **Single-Short Viewing Mode**  
  Watch one short at a time—Scroll Guard will block additional scrolling and prevent endless content feeds from taking over.

- ⏳ **Custom Limits**  
  Set time-based or scroll-based limits to guide intentional usage and build healthier habits. (Thinking about this)

## 🗒️ Note

I am free from doomscrolling myself, don't use instagram entirely, with minimal shorts usage. So I wouldn't know if anything is not working. So raise an issue if you find something amiss. Thank You.
